Experiments while learning LLVM C API

After reading [Getting Started LLVM C API](https://github.com/paulsmith/getting-started-llvm-c-api) I continued by adapting examples w/n llvm-c/examples and what I can find online.

## Build Process
* Build LLVM however you like
* Change `LLVM` in Makefile to point at root of LLVM
* w/n src directory run `make && make clean`
